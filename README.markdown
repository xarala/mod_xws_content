 * The Xws_Content module come bundled with dozens of jQuery Ui themes. Feel free to pick the desired theme in the module administration section.
 * If the bundled themes doesn't match with your site's design your can roll your own easily  with jQuery Ui theme roller web application.
 * Theming is the main advantage of using jQuery Ui for our module functionality as there is no additional css overrides required to style
